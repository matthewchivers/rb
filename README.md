# `rb` - The Repository Butler

## Description

Repo Butler (`rb`) is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to manage code repositories based on a set of configured rules. Kiss manual organisation goodbye; let `rb` take the wheel.

## Features 

The initial release of rb lays the foundation for automated repository management with the introduction of a crucial feature:

1. **Cloning of Repositories**:
   - Implement repository clone functionality, allowing users to clone git repositories to configured directories.

As `rb` is in its infancy, this feature marks the beginning of a journey towards a comprehensive repository management solution.

## Roadmap 🚀

The roadmap shows the path rb is set to take, with a glimpse of the upcoming features designed to enhance the repository management experience:

2. **Rules/Config Files**:
   - Introduce rule-based sorting where repositories can be managed based on specified rules.

3. **Opening Managed Repositories in an Editor**:
   - Develop a feature to open managed repositories directly in a specified editor.

## Usage 🎮

```bash
# Clone a single repository
rb clone [git_repo]
```
